Directed - If multiple tasks exist, each must have at least one defined upstream (previous) or downstream (subsequent) tasks, although they could easily have both. Acyclic - No task can create data that goes on to reference itself. This could cause an infinite loop that would be, um, it’d be bad. Don’t do that. Graph - All tasks are laid out in a clear structure with discrete processes occurring at set points and clear relationships made to other tasks.</description></item><item><title>Airflow Installation</title><link>https://arthurtibame.github.io/posts/data_engineer/airflow/installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 08:21:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://arthurtibame.github.io/posts/data_engineer/airflow/installation/</guid><description>What is Airflow ?
